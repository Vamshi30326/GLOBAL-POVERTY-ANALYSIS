# POVERTY-SPREAD-ACROSS-INDIA
India is a developing nation. Although its economy is growing, poverty is still a major challenge. According to United Nations Development Program administrator Achim Steiner, India lifted 271 million people out of extreme poverty in a 10-year time period from 2005–2006 to 2015–2016. Two-thirds of people in India live in poverty: 68.8% of the Indian population lives on less than $2 a day. Over 30% even have less than $1.25 per day available - they are considered extremely poor. This makes the Indian subcontinent one of the poorest countries in the world; women and children, the weakest members of Indian society, suffer most. 

In this project, we aim to describe what consequences make a growth in poverty across India. Specifically, we will aim to go beyond information retrieval to do reasoning over the dataset and visualize the consequences.
